# Simple single link list.
## Implemented for practicing purposes.
## The addRear(...) and deleteRear(...) methods are not optimized. They could be optimized by having two pointers in the node class, one for pointing to the front, and the other to the rear. 
## It would improve the time complexity from O(N) to O(1) for both methods.
